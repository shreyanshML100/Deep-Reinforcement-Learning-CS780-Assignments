Assignment 1 : 

This included implementing the Pure Exploitation Agent, Pure Exploratory Agent, Epsilon-Greedy Agent, Decaying Epsilon Greedy Agent, Softmax Agent, UCB Agent over 2 different Bandit environments: Two Armed Bernoulli Bandit, Ten Armed Gaussian Bandit and then analyzing the Reward obtained through various properties such as Instantaneous Reward, Average Reward, Regret, % Optimal Actions. Then it involved Monte Carlo Estimation and Temporal Difference Estimation of the states in a Random Walk Environment and similar Analysis of the State values for different Policies and finding the optimal state-value function starting from a given policy.
